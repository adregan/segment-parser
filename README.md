# segment-parser

To try out the Parser, run or modify `demo.js`. It works on Node v4 and greater.

The typescript source is in the `src/` directory. The demo configs are in the `config/` directory. There is also a browser build in the `lib/` directory. Never got around to doing anything with it.

## To develop

- `$ yarn install` To install the dependencies
- `$ yarn types` To run the type system in watch mode
- `$ yarn test` To run the test runner in watch mode
- `$ yarn build` To build the lib/
